White Glove - Indoor Assisted Delivery


Why did we focus on this?
	Refusal to accept delivery by customer
	Customer accepting unacticipated charges
	Returning and re-stocking product in warehouse
	Lower customer satisfaction
	Extensive resource waste

What is Build Direct's approach?
	Customer calls HQ
	Customer is asked questions and provide a quote
	

What is our solution?
	Prior to checking out, offere White Glove Service
	Automate the beginning of the phone call with HTML forms
	Give a reference # for customer to call in with.

How is this implemented?
	Using a CSS Overlay Window
	Cart metrics are pulled, and the order summed
	White Glove service based off various choice metrics
